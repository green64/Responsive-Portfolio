[Responsive-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

On the surface, this project looks like my first project, the [Basic Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/).

But wait! Reduce your browser window, or visit the URL on your table or phone, and look! It's responsive! 

It's no secret that people visit the web more and more on their mobile devices, so responsive sites are essential. I count knowing how to give my projects this flexibility among the most important things I've learned so far. 

I added responsiveness to this version using media queries. My other responsive site uses Bootstrap. I haven't implemented it yet, but I've bookmarked the information to combine the two methods on my main portfolio to ensure my text overlay doesn't end up somewhere my visitors can't see or read it.
