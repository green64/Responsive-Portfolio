[Responsive-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

On the surface, this project looks like my first project, the [Basic Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/).

But wait! Reduce your browser window, or visit the URL on your table or phone, and look! It's responsive! 

It's no secret that people visit the web more and more on their mobile devices, so responsive sites are essential. I count knowing how to give my projects this flexibility among the most important things I've learned so far.
